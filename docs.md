## Developer documentation

A high-level technical description can be found in [my thesis](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-865.pdf), particularly chapter 4.

The following are essentially excerpts from it, aiming to give a more accessible overview for people wanting to adapt, alter and debug LLPE:

* [Overview](/devdocs-overview/)
* [Symbolic memory objects](/devdocs-memory/)
* [Dead store and instruction elimination](/devdocs-dse/)
* [Conditional specialisation and runtime checks](/devdocs-conditional/)
* [Emitting specialised code](/devdocs-save/)
* [Specialising with respect to files and input streams](/devdocs-vfs/)
* [Measuring specialisation quality](/devdocs-stats/)
* [LLPE's GUI](/devdocs-gui/)
